We decided to use a linked list for the stack of directories, based on a piazza
response by Porquet.
[We consulted this website for the implementation:](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure-introduction-program)
We implemented the a modified version of the link, with pushd, popd, and dirs.

Dirs was the simplest, as we simply iterated backward through our linked list.
